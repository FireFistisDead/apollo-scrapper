# Job Title & Company Extraction - Enhanced

## ✅ What's Been Improved

The extension now has **significantly enhanced extraction** for **job titles** and **company names** from Apollo's UI.

---

## 🎯 Extraction Methods

### **Job Title Extraction (10+ selectors)**

The extension tries multiple methods to find job titles:

1. **Data attributes**: `[data-qa*="job"]`, `[data-qa*="title"]`
2. **CSS classes**: `.job-title`, `.headline`, `.title`, `[class*="job"]`
3. **Aria labels**: `[aria-label*="title"]`
4. **Table cells**: If Apollo uses table layout, extracts from 2nd column
5. **Context-based**: Searches siblings of name link for job-related terms
6. **Keyword matching**: Detects common job keywords (manager, engineer, director, etc.)

### **Company Extraction (10+ selectors)**

The extension tries multiple methods to find companies:

1. **Data attributes**: `[data-qa*="company"]`, `[data-qa*="org"]`, `[data-qa*="organization"]`
2. **CSS classes**: `.company`, `.organization`, `[class*="company"]`
3. **Aria labels**: `[aria-label*="company"]`, `[aria-label*="organization"]`
4. **Organization links**: Searches for links containing `/organizations/` or `/company/`
5. **Table cells**: If Apollo uses table layout, extracts from 3rd column
6. **Button metadata**: Checks button hrefs for organization links

## 🔧 If Job/Company Data Is Missing

If you still see empty job titles or companies after reloading:

### **Option 1: Inspect Apollo's HTML Structure**

1. Right-click on a job title in Apollo → "Inspect"
2. Copy the HTML structure
3. Share with developer to add specific selectors

### **Option 2: Check Console for Sample Data**

The console will show sample extracted data. If you see `job: "(empty)"` or `company: "(empty)"`, share the console output so we can improve selectors.

### **Option 3: Use Table View**

If Apollo has a "Table View" option, switch to it - table-based extraction often works better.
