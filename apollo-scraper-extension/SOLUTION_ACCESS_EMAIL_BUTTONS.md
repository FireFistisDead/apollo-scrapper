"Revealing emails — 25 / 25"

⏱️ Time: 1-5 seconds per email (30 seconds - 2 minutes total)
```

### Step 3: Verify Emails Extracted

```
Before (0 emails):
[Apollo Scraper] Found 0 emails automatically
[Apollo Scraper] ⚠️ 25 rows have "Access email" button

After enabling click-to-reveal:
Revealing emails — 25 / 25

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Apollo.io hides emails behind buttons to:
- Protect email addresses
- Track who accesses emails
- Limit free usage (may require credits)

**Types of Email Visibility:**

| What You See on Apollo | Extension Can Extract? | Solution |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| `john@company.com` | ✅ Yes, automatically | Just scrape |
| `Access email` button | ✅ Yes, with click-to-reveal | Enable checkbox |
| `🔒 Locked` icon | ❌ Need Apollo subscription | Upgrade account |
| `No email` | ❌ Profile has no email | Cannot extract |

## ⚙️ How Click-to-Reveal Works

```javascript
For each row:
1. Find "Access email" button
2. Click the button
3. Wait for email to appear (1-5 seconds)
4. Extract revealed email from DOM
5. Move to next row

Total time: 25 rows × 2 seconds = ~50 seconds
```

**What happens during reveal:**
- ✅ Extension clicks buttons automatically
- ✅ Waits for DOM updates
- ✅ Extracts newly revealed emails
- ✅ Shows progress bar
- ⚠️ May consume Apollo credits (check your account)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Patient
```
Click-to-reveal is SLOW but THOROUGH:
- 1 row = 1-5 seconds
- 25 rows = 30-120 seconds
- 100 rows = 2-8 minutes

⏰ Don't close the tab or navigate away!
```

### Tip 2: Check Apollo Credits
```
Some profiles require credits to reveal:
1. Check your Apollo account dashboard
2. Look for "Email credits" or similar
3. If 0 credits, some reveals may fail
```

### Tip 3: Combine with Automatic Extraction
```
Best workflow:
1. Scrape WITHOUT click-to-reveal first (fast)
2. Check how many emails found automatically
3. If most are missing, enable click-to-reveal
4. Run again for complete data
```

### Tip 4: Use for Smaller Lists
```
Click-to-reveal works best for:
✅ 1-50 contacts (1-4 minutes)
✅ High-value leads (worth the time)
✅ When you need 100% completeness

Avoid for:
❌ 100+ contacts (too slow)
❌ Quick exports (use automatic only)
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Console Output

### Your Console Showed:
```javascript
buttons: Array(19)
  3: {text: 'Access email', aria: '', href: ''}  ← This is the button!
  4: {text: 'Access Mobile', aria: '', href: ''}
  11: {text: 'Bangkok, Thailand', aria: '', href: ''}  ← Location data ✅
  15: {text: 'Banking', aria: '', href: ''}  ← Tags ✅
  
email: ""  ← Empty because not yet revealed
name: "Busara Seesuk"  ← Name extracted ✅
linkedin: "http://www.linkedin.com/in/busara-seesuk..."  ← LinkedIn ✅
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Name, LinkedIn, Location, Tags **successfully extracted**
- ⚠️ Email is **hidden** (button #3: "Access email")
- 💡 Need to **click button to reveal email**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Click-to-Reveal

### Issue 1: Still 0 Emails After Clicking
**Possible Causes:**
```
1. Apollo credits exhausted
   → Check Apollo dashboard
   → Upgrade account or wait for reset
   
2. Profiles have no emails
   → Some contacts genuinely don't have emails
   → Check manually on Apollo
   
3. Timeout too short
   → Increase timeout (see Advanced below)
```

### Issue 2: "Revealing emails" Stuck
**Solution:**
```
1. Wait 1-2 minutes (may be slow network)
2. If still stuck, close popup and try again
3. Reduce number of rows (scroll less before scraping)
```

### Issue 3: Some Emails Revealed, Others Missing
**This is normal:**
```
Success rates with click-to-reveal:
- Public profiles: 90-95% ✅
- Private profiles: 60-80% (need credits)
- Mixed list: 70-90% average

Not all profiles have emails available.
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Visual Guide

### Before (Current State):
```
Apollo Page:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name: Busara Seesuk             │
│ Title: [job title]              │
│ Company: TTB Bank               │
│ [Access email] ← Button         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Extension:

```

└─────────────────────────────────┘

Extension:
Revealing emails — 15 / 25...
25 rows — 23 emails found ✅
```

## 🚀 Advanced: Adjust Timeout

If emails take long to reveal, increase timeout:

**Edit `content_script.js` (line ~453):**
```javascript
// Current (4 seconds):
await revealEmailsForRows(rows, {timeout:4000, ...})

// Increase to 8 seconds:
await revealEmailsForRows(rows, {timeout:8000, ...})

// Increase to 10 seconds:
await revealEmailsForRows(rows, {timeout:10000, ...})
```

**Then:**
1. Reload extension: chrome://extensions/
2. Refresh Apollo page
3. Try scraping again
